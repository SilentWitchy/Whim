I think I should look into paring my mod with another one that adds better fighting mechanics/animations.
I can possibly also use their bosses for progression.

I want the mod to have two sides, horror and occult and fairly light cute fun research.
This can be interacted with directly in the book by having the quests and story be different.

I got the shard texture from https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/better-amethyst-v2/
Need to request their use or create my own from scratch

I got most of my witchy things from https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/tiny-witch-stuff/
I already sent them a message to use and credit their work. Since they havent been active in 2 years I doubt they will reply
so I need to work on replacing what I have with my own models.


Hello!
Did you have a specific way we can request new topics for your videos?
