NOTES ON WHAT I WANT THIS MOD TO BE
1. Custom potions with potion tubes and crafting
2. Spirits and artifacts
3. Thaumcraft style of research
4. Two sides Horror/occult and Cutesy/witchy

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OVERVIEW CONCEPT OF WHAT TO ADD
1. Notification on first spawn (PRESS ~ TO OPEN THE MOD MENU)
    This allows the player to choose the theme of their game.
    There should be a command to undo everything they have done and start on the other path

2. Wands, Spellbooks, and Staves. These should be called Foci
    These are how the player casts magic.
    The choice of what their magic item is, is purely cosmetic but the way to make them is different.

3. Potions
    Potion crafting will be a major section of the mod.
        There should be an item to auto craft a potion if you've learned how to make it.
        There should be different Villagers that let you buy potion reagents.
